## Overview
This repository contains code, documentation, and results from my work on debugging and validating AI model implementations for deployment on edge devices. The project focused on identifying and correcting issues in existing code sourced from Stack Overflow and verifying functionality and performance using test datasets.

## Objectives
- Analyze community-sourced AI model code for correctness and efficiency.
- Debug implementation errors affecting output accuracy.
- Validate the corrected code with representative test data.
- Assess performance for potential use on resource-constrained edge devices.

## Approach
1. **Code Review and Debugging**  
   - Identified logical and structural issues in publicly shared example code.
   - Refactored the code to improve readability and maintainability.

2. **Validation**  
   - Created test cases to verify that the corrected code produced expected outputs.
   - Measured runtime performance and resource utilization.

3. **Results**  
   - Confirmed correct functionality across multiple datasets.
   - Documented improvements in execution consistency and efficiency.
